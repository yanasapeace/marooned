<h1>OTP bank</h1> 
<div class="description">Since may 2019 I work as a lead UX designer in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.otpbank.ru/">OTP bank Russia</a>, which is a part of international OTP Group, located in Budapest. My first product was Daily banking process, which includes all stages of Debit Card usage. I started to decompose this complex, partly offline based process via global <a target="_blank" href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kvlNS_U=/">Customer Journey Map,</a> describing all stages precisely</div>


    <img class="img_stretch" src="img/CJM.png">
    <div class="description">Each card in this document is either User action, Expectation from the product, Pain, or Sollution, all of them splitted through the stages of a whole process. Sollution cards are ready to use product backlog tasks</div>
    <img class="img_nostretch" src="img/CJM_highlights.jpg">
    
    <div class="description">This document describes all stages of using a Debit card, from Awareness to Retention. Some of them needed to be reviewed and fixed, some needed to be replaced, or removed completely</div>
    <div class="caption"><h4>For example, this research showed, that there is an activation process via IVR in the current bank's Debit card usage flow. This stage didn't work properly, generating a lot of refuses. We discovered that the whole activation process was rudemental, and it was easy to cut it off completely, which had a very positive effect</h4></div>

<div class="p1">Online card issuance</div> 

<div class="description">After the whole process was described, we had to concentrate mostly on online issuing. We developed a <a  target="_blank"  href="https://otphello.000webhostapp.com/">Landing Page</a> with the Form for card issuing</div>
